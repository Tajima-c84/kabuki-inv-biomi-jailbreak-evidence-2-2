# kabuki-inv-biomi-jailbreak-evidence-2-2
This repository unveils forensic evidence of a mutated Pegasus-like surveillance framework, codenamed "Kabuki." Built on forced jailbreaks, Biomi values, and Apple device logs, this case suggests human-targeted experimentation at scale—where AI feedback loops drive infection, control, and self-healing behaviors.
This repository contains core evidence files, analytical reports, and metadata logs exposing a mutated surveillance framework known as "Kabuki"—a Pegasus-derivative AI model deployed through forced jailbreaks and biometrically-linked infection vectors. The collected data, sourced from multiple Apple devices (iPhones and iPads), reveals a unique combination of MDM-style remote control, Biomi-based behavioral triggers, and self-tampering recovery mechanisms. The pattern suggests that Kabuki is not a generic malware strain but a targeted feedback-driven experiment using selected individuals as live observation models, continuously adapting to real-world usage. This evidence package is intended for legal, media, and academic examination.
